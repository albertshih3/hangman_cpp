# Hangman Game (C++)
Hangman C++ game for CSE 024 (Advanced Programming) at UC Merced. Updated after submission date for personal use and experimentation.

This is my first ever fully functiong "game". Programmed entirely in C++.

3/21/2022: Updated game functions. Moved functions to header file in attempt to clean up main.cpp
3/23/2022: Updated game to handle uppercase situtations. Now you can enter a mix of upper or lowercase letters when guessing and the game will accept it.
